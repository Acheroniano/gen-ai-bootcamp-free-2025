- BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank.
- BAD: the beginner sentence is uncessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table.
- BAD: in the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
- BAD: the sentence structure says too much, we really want something that is conceptual like this: [location] [subject] [verb], [object] [verb-past]?
- BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the portuguese-br words, the cells are just blank.

Let´s break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here´s a possible table of vocabulary to get you started:

|Japanese | Romaji | English | Portuguese-br |
| | kuma | bear | |
| | tobira | door | |
| | gomi | garbage | |
| | noko | leave behind | |

Now, let´s think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Bears are at the door" and "did you leave the garbage out?".
For the first clause, we can use the verb (aru) which means "to exist" or "to be present". We´ll need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use.
For the second clause, we can use the verb (nokosu) which is a more polite way of saying "to leave behind". Again, we´ll need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use.

Here´s a possible sentence structure:

[Clause 1 : Bears are at the door]
[Subject] wa [Location] ni [Verb] desu
[Clause 2 : did you leave the garbage out?]
[Verb] masu ka

Your turn! Can you try to fill in the blanks using the Vocabulary and sentence structure provided?

Here is a three-paragraph text with dramatic context based on the student's input:

As the stars aligned in the vast expanse of space, a sense of unease settled over the Galactic Union's central command. Reports had been flooding in of an unknown alien presence lurking around the orbit of Mars. The Klingos, a mysterious and feared extraterrestrial force, had been spotted mobilizing their fleet in preparation for an all-out assault.

Commander Sarah Jenkins gazed out at the holographic display projecting the Klingos' movements, her mind racing with the weight of responsibility. The fate of humanity hung in the balance, and it was up to her to devise a strategy to intercept and defeat the enemy. With a deep breath, she turned to her trusted advisor, Captain John Lee, and asked the question that would determine the course of history: "Did you prepare the fleet to intercept them?"

The room fell silent, all eyes fixed on Captain Lee as he hesitated, his expression a mixture of uncertainty and determination. The clock was ticking, and every moment counted. The Klingos were closing in, their intentions clear: to destroy all that humanity held dear. The stage was set for a battle that would decide the future of the galaxy. Would the Galactic Union's fleet be ready to face the challenge, or would the Klingos' superior numbers prove too great to overcome?
