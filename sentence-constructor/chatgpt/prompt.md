    | to leave         | 出す（だす）| Transitive Godan Verb     | deixar (verbo) |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma.
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists.
    - The second part is asking about a past action.

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
